# Bucketlist
This is a 2-day project for Hackathon @ hack.summit() 2016. Done using sailsJS and AngularJS.

# The Concept
Bucketlist is a plataform that enables people to create, track their progress and share their bucketlist. Other users can/may suggest goals to other people, so they can add to their bucketlist.

People should focus on what's important in life and keep track of their wishes and their progress.
